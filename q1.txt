nVersion:
Signed integer that tells what block validation rules to follow. 
There are 4 versions that each introduced soft forking changes.

hashPrevBlock:
A SHA256 hash of the previous block header. A previous block 
can't be changed without also changing the current block's header.

hashMerkleRoot:
A SHA256 hash formed from transaction IDs of all block transactions
to ensure no changes can be made to those transactions without
changing the block.

nTime:
The Unix epoch time when the miner started hashing the header

nBits:
Stores a compact version of the target threshold that the header 
hash is compared against to determine validity of a block. 

nNonce:
Only value that miners can change to attempt to find a hash
that is less than or equal to the target. (By brute force)
